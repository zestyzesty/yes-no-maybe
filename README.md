# YesNoMaybe

YesNoMaybe is an ORM extension that allows you to store three states
in a table column: Yes, no, and maybe. Currently YesNoMaybe works with
`sequel` and `mongoid`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yes_no_maybe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yes_no_maybe

## Usage


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that
will allow you to experiment. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git
tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem`
file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
